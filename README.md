# Lending-Club-Loan-Data-Analysis
Lending club is US lending company and the data set consists of 1 million observations and 74 variables for loans issued over the span of 8 years.  Performed exploratory data analysis and data imputation and cleaning to understand the data and provide a concise input for building the models. Explored machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, LDA, QDA, Classification tree, Random Forest, SVM, xgBoost to predict the loan status as default or fully paid.  Compared the performance of these algorithms through metrics such as accuracy, error, ROC curve and confusion matrix and identified Random forest as the best model.  Identified important parameters as the factors to suggest before loan allocation.
